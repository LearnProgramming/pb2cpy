testcase A testcase is a minimal compilable example exhibiting your symptoms. "Minimal" means just the bare essentials required to illustrate your question. "Compilable" means that there is enough code to compile it on our machines, and therefore use our debuggers. Please paste a testcase at http://ideone.com or http://codepad.org to help us assist you. For a testcase checklist: http://eel.is/iso-c++/testcase/
ask Don't ask to ask, skip the pleasantries and just ask your actual question.
pedantic Technical language is not like everday speech where correcting a non-native speaker might be seen as impolite. Here it's absolutely necessary and should be seen as something neutral rather than rude or condescending.

ls DO NOT USE ls' output for anything. ls is a tool for interactively looking at directory metadata. Any attempts at parsing ls' output with code are broken. Globs are much more simple AND correct: ''for file in *.txt''. Read http://mywiki.wooledge.org/ParsingLs

[[ [[ is a bash keyword similar to (but more powerful than) the [ command. See <http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/031> and <http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashGuide/TestsAndConditionals>. Unless you're writing for POSIX sh, we recommend [[.
[ test or [ test is the POSIX test command. It can do simple tests on files and strings. In bash, you should use the more powerful [[ instead and ban [ for sake of consistency. [[ can do pattern matching, is faster and safer to use. http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashGuide/TestsAndConditionals http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/031
pe Parameter Expansion expands parameters: "$foo", "$1". You can use it to perform string or array operations: "${file%.mp3}", "${0##*/}", "${files[@]: -4}". They should *always* be quoted. See: http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/073 and "Parameter Expansion" in man bash. Also see http://wiki.bash-hackers.org/syntax/pe.
html You can't parse tag-based languages like HTML or XML using bash, grep, sed, cut, etc. See http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/113 instead.
